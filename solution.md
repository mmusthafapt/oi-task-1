The proposed solution for this task includes below key points:

1. Selecting the infrastructure platform to use
    a. Automate the infrastructure deployment 
2. Identify the orchestration technology and their components
    a. Automate the microservices deployment
3. The release lifecycle for the different components
4. The testing approach for the infrastructure
5. The Logging and monitoring approach (obeservability) for the solution

## Infrastructure Platform to Use
### Cloud (AWS)
The infrastructure platform selection depends on the environment where the microservice to be deployed. 

- A cloud-based infrastructure would be ideal due to its flexibility, scalability, and availability. A number of cloud providers can be considered. 
    1. AWS (Amazon Web Services)
    
        AWS comes with multiple services which can be used for deployment and scaling of microservices. Services like ECS and EKS are highly suitable for microservices deployment with autoscaling and high availability. 
    
        Due to its extensive flexibility, portability and advanced features EKS would be the more preferable solution for hosting the microservices.

    2. Azure

        Azure AKS provides similar stack for Kubernetes (Azure Kubernetes Service, AKS) and managed PostgreSQL services, with good autoscaling, monitoring, and deployment tools

    3. Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
    
        GCP Provides services like GKE and cloud SQL for postgresql which ensures high availability and autoscaling 

### On premises
- In an on-premise environment, Use of bare metal or virtual servers would be the options to have required compute power. To achieve high availability, redundancy and continuos service availability you need to have:
    1. Redundant power supply and networking 
    2. Hardware redundancy with Dual power supplies, raid configurations and redundant hardwares.
    3. KVM , VMWare, etc provide virtualization and make sure VMs are automatically restarted on another host incase of failures
    4. Storage redundancy with SAN/NAS , Distributed storage systems 

    Microservices can be containerized and deployed on Kubernetes clusters created with VMs or BMs as nodes. Kubernetes engines like RedHat Openshift, VMWare Tanzu, Rancher Kubernetes Engine are some available options.


## Infrastructure automation on AWS
Selecting the AWS as the infrastructure provider, below are the components to be created:
- Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for network isolation and related components like subnet, route table, IGW, NAT Gateway (for private subnet)
- EC2 Instances (for Bastion) and EKS for container orchestration
- RDS for PostgreSQL (optional as PosgreSQL can be deployed in EKS as well) 

#### Solution to Automate Infrastructure Deployment: Terraform
Reason for choice: 
- Allows defining the complete infrastructure in code 
- Provides reusable version controlled deployments
- An example for VPC creation with terraform shown [here](./aws-vpc.tf)

## Orchestration technology and components
**Kubernetes** is the preferred solution for handling container orchestration due to its scalability, HA & fault tolerance, extensive ecosystem and community support, service discovery, load balancing, security, etc.

In our case we can go with **EKS** (for cloud environment) or **RKE2** (for on-premises).

*EKS* is a Managed distribution of Kubernetes from AWS. AWS handles the control plane management and help us avoid the control plane components heavy lifting. We would be able to concentrate more on the application deployment part.

Terraform provides modules for deploying EKS and other pre-requisite components on the AWS. These modules ease the deployment of variuos components on AWS instead of identifiying and deploying each minute components. An example usage shows [here](aws-eks.tf).

On the other hand, for on premises I prefer Rancher Kubernetes Engine 2 as it is one of the lightest, opensource, secure, simple yet flexible kubernetes engine that is ideal for enterprise production workloads. 

Ansible can be used for automating the RKE2 installation on the VMs or BMs. Refer [rke2-doc](https://docs.rke2.io/install/quickstart) for installation. Once the pre-requisites are verified an ansible playbook similar to [rke2-install.yml](./rke2-install.yaml) can be used to automate rke2 installation on nodes.

We can utilize the below components in the Kubernetes for our requirement:
- Pods
- Deployment
- Statefulset 
- Services
- Ingress
- Configmaps and Secrets
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
- Pod Disruption Budget

Assuming the container images for the frontend and backend service have been developed already, frontend and backend microservices can be run as kubernetes *deployment* with multiple replicas. 

*HPA* can be used for ensuring autoscaling of pods according to the cpu/memory/traffic usage. 

*PDB*s can also be implemented to make sure there are no downtime incase of an upgrade or rollout. 

These microservices can be deployed on nodes in the same nodegroup, *nodeSelectors* can be used to achieve this.

Kubernetes *service* of type *ClusterIP* can be used to expose the frontend and backend microservices. 

An *Ingress* objecr can be created listening to the  frontend clusterIP service. SSL is terminated at the ingress level. 

There are two possible approaches for Postgres DB. We can either utilize the AWS RDS for postgresql if we are deploying it on the cloud environment or deploy postgresql as a statefulset inside Kubernetes if you are looking for more control over db.  

Terraform can be used for the automation of RDS deployment and configuration. An example configuration shows [here](src/postgres/aws-rds.tf).

PostgreSQL can be deployed in kubernetes as a statefulset with required storage provided by PVC. A sample is shown [here](src/postgres/postgres-sts.yaml).

## Automate the microservices deployment
Packaging all the microservices with **helm** eases the deployment and management of microservices with related components. 
A sampple helm package has is shown in [src/helm](src/helm/). Create helm packages for frontend, backend and Database application.

Note: There are popular third party helm packages available For PostgreSQL database like **Bitnami/Posgresql**. Using these packages avoid the complexity upto a certain level. 

Automation of the microservices deployment can be achieved using GitOps with **ArgoCD** or similar tools. ArgoCD is a more mature GitOps tool with self healing, multi-cluster support and a rich web ui. It support Helm, Kustomize, jsonnet and plain YAML. 

- Install the ArgoCD on a kubernetes cluster with [helm](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm/tree/main/charts/argo-cd) 
- Add an *ApplicationSet* for Frontend, backend and DB applications. An example is available in src/Argo/example-applicationset.yaml
- Create applicatoinsets for backend and database applications as well.

Secrets and confidential information can be securely handle with the help of Hashicorp Vault/ AWS Secret manager. Hashicorp vault can be inside or outside the kubernetes cluster. In both cases we need to integrate it with the kubernetes cluster where microservices run. 

## Release life cycle
1. **Development:**
   - Code pushed to Git.
   - CI/CD pipeline triggered (GitHub Actions).
2. **Build:**
   - Docker images built and stored in Amazon ECR / on premises docker registry from the code 
3. **Scan:**
   - Scan the docker image with Trivy
3. **Test:**
   - Unit, integration, and security tests run.
4. **Deploy:**
   - Helm charts deployed to Kubernetes via CI/CD.
   - ArgoCD fetches the code and update the deployment 

## Testing Approach
1. **Test terraform code with:**
    - terraform fmt : Format terraform code
    - terraform validate : validates the configuration files in a directory
    - terraform plan : Creates an execution plan before actually creating resources
2. **Test ansible code with:**
    - YAML Lint : TO validate YAML syntax
    - Ansible molecule : Test ansible roles with multiple instances, os and test frameworks
3. **Validate helm charts with:**
    -  helm template : to render templates 
    -  helm lint : examine a chart for possible issues
4. **SonarQube:**
    -  Check code quality by continuosly monitoring the code
5. **Software testing:**
    - Unit testing: Test a small unit of code for its functionality
    - Integration Testing: Test multiple modules ot units together
    - Performance testing: Make sure application perform properly on expected workloads
    - Acceptance testing: Whether the application meet the specified requirements 
    - Security testing: Look for vulnerabilities and other security flaws

## Logging and Monitoring Approach (Observability)

### Tools for monitoring:
1. **Prometheus:** Promtheus is a powerful, flexible monitoring solution used for collecting and storing metrics from different services. It scrapes metrics from instrumented jobs and stores them in a time series database. We can collect metrics from microservices with prometheus client libraries (client for node, golang, java, etc.), from nodes with nodeExporter and from Kubernetes objects with *Kube-State-Metrics*.
    - Install prometheus with prometheus community helm chart
    ```
    helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
    helm repo update
    helm install [RELEASE_NAME] prometheus-community/prometheus
    ```
    - An example prometheus.yaml is shown in [prometheus.yaml](src/prometheus/prometheus.yaml)

2. **ELK Stack (Log Management):** The ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana) is a powerful stack for collecting storing and visualizing log data. The below components can be used for proper log management.
    - Filebeat/Fluent bit: Helps to collect logs from each kubernetes nodes. Can be installed as a daemonset in the cluster. Helm charts are available for [filebeat](https://github.com/elastic/helm-charts/blob/main/filebeat/README.md) and [fluentbit](https://github.com/fluent/helm-charts) installation to the cluster.
    - Logstash: Processes and ingest log data into Elasticsearch.  
    - Elasticsearch: Stores and indexes log data.
    - Kibana: Visualizes log data through customizable dashboards.
    - Deploy [ECK] (https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-on-k8s/current/k8s-deploy-eck.html) on Kubernetes cluster to manage elasticsearch, kibana and logstash on the cluster.
    - Automation of deployment of filebeat/fluentbit can be achieved by adding them as Applicationsets in the ArgoCD.

3. **Grafana (Metrics Visualization):** 
    - Grafana provides beautiful dashboards to visualize metrics collected by Prometheus and ELK. It uses prometheus , Elasticsearch as data source and deplay it in customizable dashboards. 
    - An example dashboard configuration can be seen in src/grafana/dashboard.json
    - Grafana provides an *Alertmanager* to configure and handle alerts.
    - These alerts can be integrated with Slack, PagerDuty and other messaging services.
    - Grafana also provide helm chart for installation in Kubernetes. Adding it to the ArgoCD as an applicationset automate the management of Grafana

4. **AWS CloudWatch:** 
    - Monitor AWS Resources.
    - It collects and tracks metrics, collects and monitors log files, and sets alarms.

Prometheus, Grafana, vault & ELK stack can be installed and managed inside and ouside of the kubernetes cluster(on same or different). However, deploying them on the kubernetes cluster and automating its management with ArgoCD by adding Applicationsets for each components is the recommended approach.
